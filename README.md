# Sql-Data Analytics Project

1.	Create Database and Schemas
/*=======================================================================/*
Database Exploration
Table Used:
    - INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    - INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
==============================================================================
2.	Dimensions Exploration
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To explore the structure of dimension tables.
	
SQL Functions Used:
    - DISTINCT
    - ORDER BY
  3.   Date Range Exploration 
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To determine the temporal boundaries of key data points.
    - To understand the range of historical data.

SQL Functions Used:
    - MIN(), MAX(), DATEDIFF()
 4.  Measures Exploration (Key Metrics)
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To calculate aggregated metrics (e.g., totals, averages) for quick insights.
    - To identify overall trends or spot anomalies.

SQL Functions Used:
    - COUNT(), SUM(), AVG()
5.  Magnitude Analysis
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To quantify data and group results by specific dimensions.
    - For understanding data distribution across categories.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()
    - GROUP BY, ORDER BY
6.  Ranking Analysis
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To rank items (e.g., products, customers) based on performance or other metrics.
    - To identify top performers or laggards.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Window Ranking Functions: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), TOP
    - Clauses: GROUP BY, ORDER BY
7.  Change Over Time Analysis
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To track trends, growth, and changes in key metrics over time.
    - For time-series analysis and identifying seasonality.
    - To measure growth or decline over specific periods.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Date Functions: DATEPART(), DATETRUNC(), FORMAT()
    - Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()
8.  Cumulative Analysis
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To calculate running totals or moving averages for key metrics.
    - To track performance over time cumulatively.
    - Useful for growth analysis or identifying long-term trends.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Window Functions: SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER()
9.  Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time.
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track yearly trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.
10.  Data Segmentation Analysis
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To group data into meaningful categories for targeted insights.
    - For customer segmentation, product categorization, or regional analysis.

SQL Functions Used:
    - CASE: Defines custom segmentation logic.
    - GROUP BY: Groups data into segments.
11.  Part-to-Whole Analysis
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To compare performance or metrics across dimensions or time periods.
    - To evaluate differences between categories.
    - Useful for A/B testing or regional comparisons.

SQL Functions Used:
    - SUM(), AVG(): Aggregates values for comparison.
    - Window Functions: SUM() OVER() for total calculations.
==============================================================================
12.  Customer Report
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
	2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
    3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
	   - total orders
	   - total sales
	   - total quantity purchased
	   - total products
	   - lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
	    - recency (months since last order)
		- average order value
		- average monthly spend
13.  Product Report
==============================================================================
Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
    2. Segments products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
    3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
       - total orders
       - total sales
       - total quantity sold
       - total customers (unique)
       - lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
       - recency (months since last sale)
       - average order revenue (AOR)
       - average monthly revenue
